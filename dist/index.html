I have technical and problem solving skills and I specialize in Gameplay Programming, Rigging, Scripting and Tool Development/Prototyping.</p><p>I was born and grew up in Michigan. Video games and problem solving have always been a passion of mine, although I didn’t initially want to get into the video game industry. I knew I wanted to be in something detail oriented and technical, and had considered professions such as; jewelry, drafting and physics. It wasn’t until I took a sculpting class that I decided I wanted to get into video games doing modeling. I took all of my basic classes at Schoolcraft Community College and earned an AA in the process.</p><p>I then moved to Savannah to study at SCAD as a double major. I had the intention of concentrating in modeling, but after taking the character set-up class I switched to concentrating in Character TD, which was also a minor. When I started learning MEL scripting, I really got into it and found that I was actually quite good, so I continued learning more programming to push my skills towards tool development. I had even started teaching myself higher level mathematics.</p><p>Now currently at CSUN studying Computer Science, I have the intent of concentrating on graphics programming, but it&rsquo;s possible that my path will change.</p><p>Besides college, I have worked in food service for almost 8 years. I also volunteered for the Girl Scouts as a co-leader for my friend’s troop and even taught them about animation and game development, which was part of their Entertainment Technology badge.</p></div></div></div></section></div><div id="l-footer"></div></div><script src="/static/js/app.js"></script></body></html>
