<h1>About</h1>

<div class="about">
    <p>My name is Kory Dondzila and I&rsquo;m an Animation and Game Development student at Savannah College of Art and Design. I have technical and problem solving skills and I specialize in Rigging, Scripting and Tool Development/Prototyping.</p>
    <p>I was born and grew up in Michigan. Video games and problem solving have always been a passion of mine, although I didn&rsquo;t initially want to get into the video game industry. I knew I wanted to be in something detail oriented and technical, and had considered professions such as; jewelry, drafting and physics. It wasn&rsquo;t until I took a sculpting class that I decided I wanted to get into video games doing modeling. I took all of my basic classes at Schoolcraft Community College and earned an AA in the process.</p>
    <p>I then moved to Savannah to study at SCAD as a double major. I had the intention of concentrating in modeling, but after taking the character set-up class I switched to concentrating in Character TD, which was also a minor. When I started learning MEL scripting, I really got into it and found that I was actually quite good, so I continued learning more programming to push my skills towards tool development. I have even started teaching myself higher level mathematics.</p>
    <p>Besides college, I currently work at Houlihan&rsquo;s Bar and Grill and have been working in food service for 6 years. I also volunteer for the Girl Scouts as a co-leader for my friend&rsquo;s troop and even taught them about animation and game development, which was part of their Entertainment Technology badge.</p>
